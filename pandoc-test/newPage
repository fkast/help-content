<h1 id="quick-overview">Quick Overview:</h1>
<p>We use the PaperCut managed system printing for students on campus. This allows quick and easy printing from any of the many release stations. The general process for connecting to PaperCut printing system on any computer is as follows:</p>
<p>Install and run the PaperCut Client software (see download links below), and enter your Simon’s Rock login credentials. Connect to the central printer (also called the queue); it’s conveniently named “Central” and it resides on the server “print” Make the central printer your default.</p>
<p>Details are provided below for Windows, Mac, and Linux setups.</p>
<h1 id="papercut-client-setup">PaperCut Client Setup:</h1>
<p>The PCClient software identifies your print jobs to the PaperCut system. To print to a campus printer, PCClient must be running so you can login to PaperCut when you submit a print job.</p>
<h2 id="pcclient-for-windows-mac">PCClient for Windows &amp; Mac</h2>
<p>Use the links below to download the PCClient installer for your system. (Note: you must be on-campus for these links to work)</p>
<p>Windows Mac OSX 10.7-10.10 Mac OSX PRE-10.7</p>
<h2 id="pcclient-for-linux">PCClient for Linux</h2>
<p>In order for the Linux PCClient to work, you must first have a recent Java version installed on your computer (at least version 5). For many Linux distros, you can check this from the command line with <code>java -version</code> to verify that Java is installed. If not, research the appropriate packages for your system. [If you're running a debian-based distro, for example, install with <code>sudo apt-get install java-common</code>.]</p>
<p>After you have confirmed that Java is installed, download the PCClient package. Extract it with the following command: <code>tar -xf pcclient-linux.tar.gz</code> After extracting the file, find and run the pc-client-linux.sh script to launch the PaperCut client. [Note: You’ll have to run this script each time you wish to use PaperCut; you may wish to configure your machine to auto-start it whenever you login to your X graphical desktop environment].</p>
<h2 id="saving-your-setup">Saving Your Setup</h2>
<p>The Windows and Mac installers configure the PCClient software to run each time you log into your computer. After installation, PCClient will prompt you to login with your Simon's Rock user ID and password. (These are the same credentials you use for campus email and the &quot;Inside&quot; web pages. Note that your user ID is just the first part of your email address, not the <span class="citation" data-cites="simons-rock.edu">@simons-rock.edu</span>).</p>
<p>The PCClient will prompt you to login with your Simon's Rock user ID and password. (These are the same credentials you use for campus email and the &quot;internal&quot; web pages; i.e. the first part of your email address, excluding <span class="citation" data-cites="simons-rock.edu">@simons-rock.edu</span>). If you are running it on your own computer, you may specify that it should save your credentials &quot;Always,&quot; so that you do not need to re-enter your data each time you print. At shared library and lab computers, PaperCut will only allow you to save your login credentials for several minutes.</p>

<p>After you submit a job to the central server, PaperCut will pop-up a dialog box to remind you that the job is waiting in the queue for you to release it. If you do not see this prompt, you will need to resolve the problem and try to print again before you go to a release station to output your job.</p>
<p>You may also log in to the PaperCut server your printing history and also check which jobs you have queued for printing. Use the link above, or the &quot;Details&quot; link on the PCClient software window.</p>
<p>Confirm that the PCClient software is running before you print. On Windows, there should be a PCClient icon in the tray near the clock. On Macs, check that it is running in the Dock. Manually restart the PCClient program if it is not running.</p>
<p>If PCClient is running but does not pop up a login when you first print, confirm that you installed the printer using the exact addresses shown above. If you enter the wrong address for the print queue, PaperCut will not respond to your print requests.</p>
<h1 id="printing-double-sided-vs-single-sided">Printing double-sided vs single-sided</h1>
<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
<p>In order to choose double-sided printing, after you choose to print a document (File &gt; Print in most programs), select your printer and click &quot;Preferences&quot;. From here, you can choose &quot;Two-Sided (Duplex) Printing&quot; to print double-sided or &quot;General Everyday Printing&quot; to print single-sided. If you print a large document single-sided you will be prompted by the papercut software to inform you that you would save paper by instead printing double-sided and are given an opportunity to change your print job before it is sent to the server.</p>
<h2 id="osx">OSX</h2>
